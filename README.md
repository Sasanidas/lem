After installing lem, you can start developing in Common Lisp at once.

You can skip over writing tidy settings or installing many plugins as you do on Emacs.

Lem supports other programming languages thanks to its built-in LSP
client. You can choose between an Emacs and a Vim mode.

Other Lem features include:

- a **project explorer** tree view
- project-aware commands
- interactive **grep** and **git** interfaces
- **multiple cursors**
- tetris
- and more‚Ä¶
